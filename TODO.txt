Refactoring

- Sort order (ascending/descending)
- Enum sort (labels, constants, compare functions)
- discreteFourierTransform with a single array of complex numbers

Bugfix

- Sometimes the drawing loops around and connects back to the first value.
  Supposedly caused by time being equal to 2Pi so it's kind of expected.
  But. It. Must. Go.
  
- After the drawing is completed, keep the values drawn but get rid of the epicycles and the image.
  Or scale the image to match the mapped point.
  Or keep the image and draw the points on top of it, but it has to be the original points, not the mapped ones.
  Image needs an alpha by the way.
